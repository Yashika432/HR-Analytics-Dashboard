# HR-Analytics-Dashboard 

This project is part of my internship as a Data Analyst, where I created an interactive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI.

# ðŸ“Š Overview:
This project features an interactive dashboard built to explore and visualize key HR metrics, including employee attrition trends, department-wise performance, compensation breakdowns, and work-life balance insights.

The dashboard empowers HR teams to:
- Identify factors influencing employee attrition
- Monitor department-specific retention and satisfaction levels
- Compare job roles in terms of salary, tenure, and promotion trends
- Improve strategic decision-making based on data-driven insights

# Dashboard Highlights:
